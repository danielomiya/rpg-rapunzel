# RPG 'SALVE A RAPUNZEL'

Simple project developed using Python, to explore basic structures such as data types, functions and conditional expressions.

## Built with

- Python (3.7.2)

## How to get it running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gwyddie/rpg-rapunzel.git # clone repo
cd rpg-rapunzel # change directory

python __main__.py # run it
```

## How it works

The game begins presenting itself, then you're repeatedly asked for which action you take under a specific situation.

If you take the right path, you'll end up saving the princess Rapunzel.

Because it uses random functions dozens of times, different matches will hardly be the same.
